Over the years I have spent many many many hours off "in" thought, and during this time I was able to witness amazing aspects of the reality we currently inhabit. Unfortunately you are not given an option to select your family, and had I the option, I more than likely would have selected a few of my direct family.... But surely there is some I would not have bothered to include. The part about the first half of my time here has to be "bill" (or the auspice of 'freewill'), and the fact that he has steadfastly harrassed my existence at every opportunity.

This individual and his 'team' of individuals has repeatedly attempted to limit my impact on the world around me through various means, and on which I will muse in this document for posterity, and going forward in order to document where I notice issues or receive some knowledge relative to what has or is happening.
