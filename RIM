Over the years I have spent many many many hours off "in" thought, and during this time I was able to witness amazing aspects of the reality we currently inhabit. Unfortunately you are not given an option to select your family, and had I the option, I more than likely would have selected a few of my direct family.... But surely there is some I would not have bothered to include. The part about the first half of my time here has to be "bill" (or the auspice of 'freewill'), and the fact that he has steadfastly harrassed my existence at every opportunity.

This individual and his 'team' of individuals has repeatedly attempted to limit my impact on the world around me through various means, and on which I will muse in this document for posterity, and going forward in order to document where I notice issues or receive some knowledge relative to what has or is happening. Now there is an overarching theme to all of this knowledge I've acquired in my travels (both at night and during the day).


I was arrested a few years ago just after new years, and oddly while I was sleeping (@NORwalk) I had a dream about Tom Brady and I fighting, and on the cusp of his defeat he opened his button up shirt to reveal that he was a red light being. He then motioned to some aspect of his form exploding out. Just then as I awoke to the police kicking me in the rib to question whether "I was sovereign". Now this was quite as few years ago now, but I have often returned to that space, and have watched in horror as it slowly became the space we currently inhabit, as our world transforms around us seemingly guided (but by what?). 
  During a subsequent return to this space of thought very much reminiscent of Mad Max I found myself traveling around with a former leader assessing the situation.... It reminded me very much of our current situation, and how we are having to rebuild the social contract, yet without disclosure it will still be a pent up tent ready for the first calf to upend its pole. I for the longest time was looking at this with the wrong eyes, but now that I see what lie is propping up this system (and it's controls), I know this will not be solved as it has been in the past.
